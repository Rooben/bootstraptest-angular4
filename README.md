********* Setup *********** 
1) Make sure you have angular-cli installed globally with the command: `npm install -g @angular/cli`
2) Navigate to the root directory and then run the command npm install
3) After "npm install" has finished downloading all it's modules, run `ng serve` and it should set up 
  the web server, by default at port 4200.
4) Open your favourite browser and type in the address: `localhost:4200` and that should display the site.

*** NOTE: that this is just a quick demostration of an angular4 front-end architecture, once this is is setup, the
rest is easy.
